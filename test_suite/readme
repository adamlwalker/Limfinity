This folder will contain a Automated User Acceptence Test suite for Limfinity. The suite run in a jruby enviroment with selenium-webdriver, Sikuli, nokogiri and cucumber. 

The tests can be run based on keywords or all at once.

Test results are available as HTML or JSON and can include screenshots and/or recorded video of each test.

Example tests written in plain english using Gherkin:

Feature: Testing some basic Limfinity functions
Description: This is a proof of concept showing that end user tests can be fully automated with image capture and plain language

	Scenario: Add freezer
	Scenario Background: Simple navigation example showing browser manipulation in a biobank implementation
		When I open a new browser window
		Then I navigate to "http://biobanx.ruro.com"
		And I login with the username "adam" and password "password321"
		Then I check for the welcome screen
		And I take a screenshot and name it "loggedin"
		Then I click the quicklink "Add New CTU"
		And I wait for the "Add Freezer" dialog
		Then I enter the name "-80c Freezer"
		And I click OK and take a screenshot and name it "newfreezer"
                Then I verify a new tab is open named "-80c Freezer"
		Then I logout 
		And close browser
	
	@limfinity	@login
	Scenario: Limfinity Change Password
	Scenario Description: In this scenario we are using the Sikuli java library to change a user password 
		Given I open a new browser window
		And I navigate to "http://biobanx.ruro.com"
		And I login with the username "adam" and password "password321"
		Then I navigate to "Settings and Preferences"
		Then I click "Users"
		And I change password for "adam" to "newpassword123"
		And I take a screenshot and name it "changedpassword"
		Then I logout
		And I login with the username "adam" and password "newpassword123"
		Then I logout
		And close browser

I plan on adding instructions for adding workflow and tool validations. For example, if you had a run script tool that calculated the hamming distance of 2 strands of DNA and submitted the result to a "Hamming Distance" UDF:

		Given I am viewing subject "12345"
		And subject "12345" is in the "enter results" state
		When I click "Calculate Hamming"
                And enter "GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT" in field1
                And enter "CATCGTAATGACGGCCT" in field2
                Then I click "OK"
                And the "Hamming Distance" UDF should contain "7"
